# python-challenge

## Part 1: PyBank
For this part of the challenge, I used python to open and read a csv file, iterate through through that file, log the relevant data, output a summary to the console, and write the same summary to a text file located in a different folder.

1. I used [javatpoint.com](https://www.javatpoint.com/how-to-get-2-decimal-places-in-python) to find out how to round the average_change to two deciaml places.

2. I also used [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/print-newline-in-python/#:~:text=Using%20the%20escape%20character%20%5Cn,use%20a%20different%20escape%20sequence.) to find out how to insert a new line when outputting a combined strings.


## Part 2: PyPoll
In this challenge, I opened and read a csv file, looped through that file, add the candidates to a list, track each candidates total votes, and track the total vote count for all the candidates. Initially, I declared the candidate's name. Unfourtunately, I didn't think that I could run that code on a similar but different dataset. So, I did use [ChatGPT]() to find alternatives. I did find a solution that I think one could reuse on a different election, as long as the dataset was ordered in the same way. This is accomplished by appending candidates as they show up in the loop to a candidates list. Then, a dictionary imports that name and tracks the votes for that candidate.

1. I used [ChatGPT]() to find alternative ways to both tracking candidates names and the amount of votes they recieve.
